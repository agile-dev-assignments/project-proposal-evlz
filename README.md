## Project Title: Waitlisted? 

### What and why?
What: We want to build a software that predict the likeliness of getting into a class at NYU, given the students waitlist position and class size, using sample data that we will collect.

Why: Students are often uncertain of what their schedule will be, and that causes a lot of headaches, and this app will help you determine if you should stay on the waitlist or start looking for alternatives to alleviate some of the stress.

### For whom?
For all NYU (undergraduate) students!

### How?
The users would go to a website where the app is hosted. They will be prompted to enter their waitlist position, the course name, the last day of add/drop. The app will then give them the likeliness of entering, based on the data we have such as the usual class sizes which can be collected.

### Scope:
This app would not too easy to make given the component of data collection and analysis. There are seperate cases where data collection can be difficult. 

Case 1: If we do have access to historical data of class sizes it would be easy to make predictions but we need to identify patterns and apply it through an algorithm. 

Case 2: If we do not have access to historical data, we can ask current students of the classes to enter the class sizes and use it for future predictions. However this would mean that the app would be less accurate in the first few periods.

However, once we have the data, the technical aspects should not be too complex. We would just need to be able to monitor the waitlists and come up with a prediction algorithm on the back end, and a pretty UI for the front end.
